helped me. This is not a exhaustive list of books that I like.</h4><br/><h4>Also, feel free to contact me to discuss on any of the books mentioned below or any of your suggestions</h4><br/><br/><ol><li><h3>Inside The Tornado</h3><h4>By Geoffrey A. Moore</h4><div><br />
<p>A must read for people in field of tech.</p>
<p>I have underlined all the good points, in my perspective, in the copy that I own. I made this page after I had read the book, so when I am able to find time to go back and reread the book I will update it here. Also, Feel free to ask me for the copy that I own. </p>
<br/>
<br/></div></li><li><h3>How to stop worrying and start living</h3><h4>By Dale Carnegie</h4><div><br />
<p>Another book by Dale Carnegie.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask me for the copy that I own.</p>
<br/>
<br/></div></li><li><h3>How to make friends and influence people</h3><h4>By Dale Carnegie</h4><div><br />
<p>Warren Buffet does not have diploma from University of Nebraska or from Columbia hanging on his office wall, but he does have is Dale Carnegie course graduation certificate proudly displayed on the wall. </p>
<p>This book contains everything form the course, and certainly a lot more. I find this book really interesting, and didn't see any point in making notes as the book itself is very clear.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask me for the copy that I own. </p>
<br/>
<br/></div></li><li><h3>Security Analysis (sixth edition)</h3><h4>Benjamin Graham &amp; David L. Dodd</h4><div><br/>
<p>This was a tough one again. I won't recommend this to people not interested in finance. Plus I am still trying a understand complex things in it, so once I do I will update my notes here.</p>
<br/>
<br/></div></li><li><h3>The Inevitable</h3><h4>By Kevin Kelly</h4><div><br/>
<p>Most people know Kevin Kelly, but for the ones who don't he co-founded Wired Magazine (<a href="https://kk.org/">link to his site</a>).
When he is writing about 12 technological forces that can change the world. It is a must read.
Also, sorry for this again, I was too lazy while reading his books that I didn't make any notes. I will do it when I reread the book.
Also, feel free to ask me for the copy that I own. </p>
<br/>
<br/></div></li><li><h3>The Intelligent Investor</h3><h4>Benjamin Graham</h4><div><br/>
<p>This was a tough one. I still don't understand all the concepts very well, but from what I know at present this book is a must read irrespective of your background. </p>
<p>Also, I will be updating notes on this book soon. </p>
<p>Feel free to ask me for the copy that I own. </p>

<br/></div></li><li><h3>Man&#x27;s search for meaning</h3><h4>By Viktor E. Frankl</h4><div><br />
<p>"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how" -- Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
<br />
<p>"Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest of power, as Alfred Adler  taught, but a quest for meaning. The great task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl Saw three possible sources of meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person, as Frankl held on to the image of his wife through the darkest days in Auschwitz), and in courage in difficult times." -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<p>"Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<p>"At one point, he writes that a person 'may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.' He concedes that only a few prisoners of the Nazis were able to do the former, 'but even one such example is sufficient proof that man's inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.'".  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<p>"Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<p>Ref to <em>Incident at Vichy play</em> "The man, whose self-esteem had always depended on the respect of others, emotionally destroyed. Frankl would have argued that we are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose how we will respond"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<p>"Why to live for enabled them to bear how"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<p>"Frankl's doctrine of logotherapy curing the soul by leading it to find meaning in life, gains credibility against the background of his anguish in Auschwitz"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<p>Referring to <em>Man's Search for meaning</em> Harold S. Kushner writes, in preface, "It insists that life is meaningful and that we must learn to see life as meaningful despite our circumstances"</p>
<br/>
<p>A very powerful paragraph - "Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips."</p>
<br/>
<p>Viktor Frankl writes the following as a response to the book's success - "Whereupon I react by reporting that in the first place I do not at all see in the best seller status of my book an achievement and accomplishment on my part but rather an expression of the misery of our time: if hundreds of thousands of people reach out for a book whose very title promises to deal with the question of meaning of life, it must be a question that burns under their fingernail"</p>
<br/>
<p>"Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue", and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out the best of your knowledge. Then you will to see that in the long run -- in the long run, I say! -- success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it." -- Viktor Frankl</p>
<br/>
<br/></div></li><li><h3>The Art Spirit</h3><h4>By Robert Henri</h4><div><br />
<p>Today must not be souvenir of yesterday, and so the struggle is everlasting. Who am I today? What do I see today? How shall I use what I know, and how shall I avoid becoming victim on what I know? Life is not repetition. -- Page 114.</p>
<br />
<p>Now to deal with the work from another viewpoint and give you further criticism I will say that my impression of your two paintings made me feel that in doing them you were trying to fit yourself into a kind of work, done to your admiration by another artist, but quite outside your power of concept. I think your only salvation is in finding yourself, and you will never find yourself unless you quit preconceiving what you will be when you have found yourself. What after all, are your greatest, deepest, and all-possessing interests? Most people seem to think they are great enough to know beforehand, and what generally results is that they imprison themselves in some sort of <em>Girl and Goldfish</em> subject, which, as I say, they may admire from the hand of another but for which they have no personal vocation. Those who are so imprisoned work like prisoners. You can see where the heart is out of it. Pictures tell the story of actual impulse in the artist -- or the lack of it.
What you need is to free yourself from your own preconceived ideas about yourself. It will take a revolution to it. --- Page 193.</p>
<br/>
<p>The members of the other group tend toward a simplicity of sight, are conscious of a main current, are related to the past, see into the future, are not of time present, but extend forward and back. ----- Page 204</p>
<br/>
<p>Be game -- take a chance -- don't hide behind veils and veils of discretion. The spirit of youth should be in the young. Don't try to be ponderous. Youth has clear eyes. Let your colors be as seen with clear eyes. Go forward with what you have to say, expressing things as tou see them. You are new evidence, fresh and young. Your work, the spirit of youth, you are the progress of human evolution. If age dulls you it will be time enough then to be ponderous and heavy -- or quit. ----- Page 204</p>
<br/>
<p>Keep up the work. Try to reduce everything you see to the utmost simplicity. That is, let nothing but the things which are utmost importance to you have any place. The more simply you will see, the more simply you will render. People see too much, scatteringly. --- Page 207</p>
<br/>
<p>Get as much acquainted with yourself. Question yourself. - Page 212</p>
<br/>
<p>Decide your yourself</p>
<br/>
<p>My advice to you is to venture, meet some other difficulties, be a real student</p>
<br/>
<p>After all, your "method" of work is nothing. Why be tied to any method? You will say that when you step out of your rut you don't do as well. But what does that matter? It may come better latter. Anyway, don't be a slave to a "method," to a 5-by-9 piece of paper. Don't let anyone drive you away from your method and you 5-by-9 piece of paper. Don't be a slave either way. Ask yourself. -- Page 212</p>
<br/>
<p>Do not let the fact that things are not made for you, that conditions are not as they should be, stop you. Go on any-way. Everything depends on those who go on anyway. -- Page 212</p>
<br/>
<p>Never lose sight of who you are. Remain true yourself</p>
<br/>
<p>Difficulties lies not in new ideas but escaping from old ones -- Keynes</p>
<br/>
<p>I am not particular how you take this, scientifically or otherwise, my simple motive is to make such suggestions as will bring strongly to mind the thought tht the student in the school or the artist in the studio must be in a highly sensitive and receptive mood, that negligence is not a characteristic of the artist, that he must not bind himself with preconceived ides, must keep himself free in the attitude...--- Page 236</p>
