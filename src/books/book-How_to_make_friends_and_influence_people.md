Warren Buffet does not have diploma from University of Nebraska or from Columbia hanging on his office wall, but he does have is Dale Carnegie course graduation certificate proudly displayed on the wall. 

This book contains everything form the course, and certainly a lot more. I find this book really interesting, and didn't see any point in making notes as the book itself is very clear.

Feel free to ask me for the copy that I own.
