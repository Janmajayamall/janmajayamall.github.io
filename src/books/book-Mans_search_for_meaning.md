"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how" -- Friedrich Nietzsche

<br />

"Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest of power, as Alfred Adler  taught, but a quest for meaning. The great task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl Saw three possible sources of meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person, as Frankl held on to the image of his wife through the darkest days in Auschwitz), and in courage in difficult times." -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl

<br/>

"Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl

<br/>

"At one point, he writes that a person 'may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.' He concedes that only a few prisoners of the Nazis were able to do the former, 'but even one such example is sufficient proof that man's inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.'".  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl

<br/>

"Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl

<br/>

Ref to *Incident at Vichy play* "The man, whose self-esteem had always depended on the respect of others, emotionally destroyed. Frankl would have argued that we are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose how we will respond"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl

<br/>

"Why to live for enabled them to bear how"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl

<br/>

"Frankl's doctrine of logotherapy curing the soul by leading it to find meaning in life, gains credibility against the background of his anguish in Auschwitz"  -- Harold S. Kushner (Preface) in Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl

<br/>

Referring to *Man's Search for meaning* Harold S. Kushner writes, in preface, "It insists that life is meaningful and that we must learn to see life as meaningful despite our circumstances"

<br/>

A very powerful paragraph - "Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips."

<br/>

Viktor Frankl writes the following as a response to the book's success - "Whereupon I react by reporting that in the first place I do not at all see in the best seller status of my book an achievement and accomplishment on my part but rather an expression of the misery of our time: if hundreds of thousands of people reach out for a book whose very title promises to deal with the question of meaning of life, it must be a question that burns under their fingernail"

<br/>

"Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue", and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out the best of your knowledge. Then you will to see that in the long run -- in the long run, I say! -- success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it." -- Viktor Frankl
