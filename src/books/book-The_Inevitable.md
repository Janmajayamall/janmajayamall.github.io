Most people know Kevin Kelly, but for the ones who don't he co-founded Wired Magazine ([link to his site](https://kk.org/)).
When he is writing about 12 technological forces that can change the world. It is a must read. 
Also, sorry for this again, I was too lazy while reading his books that I didn't make any notes. I will do it when I reread the book. 
Also, feel free to ask me for the copy that I own.
