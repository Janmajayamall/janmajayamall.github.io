Today must not be souvenir of yesterday, and so the struggle is everlasting. Who am I today? What do I see today? How shall I use what I know, and how shall I avoid becoming victim on what I know? Life is not repetition. -- Page 114.

Now to deal with the work from another viewpoint and give you further criticism I will say that my impression of your two paintings made me feel that in doing them you were trying to fit yourself into a kind of work, done to your admiration by another artist, but quite outside your power of concept. I think your only salvation is in finding yourself, and you will never find yourself unless you quit preconceiving what you will be when you have found yourself. What after all, are your greatest, deepest, and all-possessing interests? Most people seem to think they are great enough to know beforehand, and what generally results is that they imprison themselves in some sort of *Girl and Goldfish* subject, which, as I say, they may admire from the hand of another but for which they have no personal vocation. Those who are so imprisoned work like prisoners. You can see where the heart is out of it. Pictures tell the story of actual impulse in the artist -- or the lack of it.
What you need is to free yourself from your own preconceived ideas about yourself. It will take a revolution to it. --- Page 193.

The members of the other group tend toward a simplicity of sight, are conscious of a main current, are related to the past, see into the future, are not of time present, but extend forward and back. ----- Page 204

Be game -- take a chance -- don't hide behind veils and veils of discretion. The spirit of youth should be in the young. Don't try to be ponderous. Youth has clear eyes. Let your colors be as seen with clear eyes. Go forward with what you have to say, expressing things as tou see them. You are new evidence, fresh and young. Your work, the spirit of youth, you are the progress of human evolution. If age dulls you it will be time enough then to be ponderous and heavy -- or quit. ----- Page 204

<br/>

Keep up the work. Try to reduce everything you see to the utmost simplicity. That is, let nothing but the things which are utmost importance to you have any place. The more simply you will see, the more simply you will render. People see too much, scatteringly. --- Page 207

Get as much acquainted with yourself. Question yourself. - Page 212

<br/>

Decide your yourself

<br/>

My advice to you is to venture, meet some other difficulties, be a real student

<br/>

After all, your "method" of work is nothing. Why be tied to any method? You will say that when you step out of your rut you don't do as well. But what does that matter? It may come better latter. Anyway, don't be a slave to a "method," to a 5-by-9 piece of paper. Don't let anyone drive you away from your method and you 5-by-9 piece of paper. Don't be a slave either way. Ask yourself. -- Page 212

<br/>

Do not let the fact that things are not made for you, that conditions are not as they should be, stop you. Go on any-way. Everything depends on those who go on anyway. -- Page 212

<br/>

Never lose sight of who you are. Remain true yourself

<br/>

Difficulties lies not in new ideas but escaping from old ones -- Keynes

<br/>

I am not particular how you take this, scientifically or otherwise, my simple motive is to make such suggestions as will bring strongly to mind the thought tht the student in the school or the artist in the studio must be in a highly sensitive and receptive mood, that negligence is not a characteristic of the artist, that he must not bind himself with preconceived ides, must keep himself free in the attitude...--- Page 236
